That sounds like an exciting set of projects! Given the diverse topics you're covering, here are some suggestions and brief explanations for each area. If you need specific MATLAB code examples or detailed explanations for any of these areas, let me know!

1. Communication Systems
Overview:
In the context of a mobile robot, communication systems facilitate data exchange between robots and a central controller or between robots themselves in a distributed network.

Example:
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Communication: Implementing wireless communication protocols to send and receive data between robots.
Packet Loss Handling: Implementing techniques to handle packet loss or delays in data transmission.
